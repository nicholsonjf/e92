To Do
-Remove uart supervisor function (done)
    -Integrate uart with device independent io
    -Add UART0-5 to get_device function mapped as /dev/uart0 etc.
-Create a new device driver "stdstrm" and use it to create stdin, stdout, stderr
    -stdin will have a 256 byte malloc'd buffer
    -stdout will have a 8192 byte malloc'd buffer
    -stderr will have a 256 byte malloc'd buffer
