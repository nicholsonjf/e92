/*
 * Input a line using uartGetchar
 *
 * The line is terminated by a UARTNL_END_OF_INPUT_LINE_CHAR character
 * entered by the user.  The size parameter is the total size of the
 * string pointed to by "p" which must include space for a terminating
 * NUL character.
 *
 * All input characters are echoed back on the same UART channel.  An
 * input new-line is echoed as carriage-return then new-line.
 *
 * If the space allocated for the inputted string is exhausted, then the
 * string is correctly NUL terminated and no more characters are input.
 *
 * If the input entered includes any backspace (BS, Control-H) or
 * delete (DEL) characters, they will be used to delete previous characters
 * already typed, if any exist.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  uartChannel  UART channel on which to output a string
 *  p            pointer to string to be filled in with inputted chars
 *  size         the total number of characters allocated for the string
